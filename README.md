cool game

After the first attempt I realized I made too many assumptions when building the program and I made errors early in the program that I did not realize until it was too late.

Instead of spending hours debugging the program I chose to start over. This time taking smaller, simpler steps in order to make sure everything was well thought out. With this method I had a better understanding for the logic of the program and implemented a new method than the first time, using nested if statements.

For example, at first I used set values for playerSelection and computerSelection while I was working on each condition until I understood the logic behind the nested if statement and could implement prompt() for user input and computerPlay() for computer generated input

Decided to break my program since I was stuck on getting the final results on the game. Finally finished the program.
